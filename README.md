# Noah's configuration files

This repo is used to hold my configuration files and will allow for bootstrapping a MacOS or Ubuntu installation

## Getting Started

In order to do the automatic install clone the repo into its own directory, then run thebootstrap script. If you don't want to do so, the dotfiles are organized such that you may pick and chose the ones you desire.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is git... All others should be automatically installed.
